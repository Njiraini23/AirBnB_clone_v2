## []()Background Context

Environment variables will be your best friend for this project!

-   `HBNB_ENV`: running environment. It can be “dev” or “test” for the moment (“production” soon!)
-   `HBNB_MYSQL_USER`: the username of your MySQL
-   `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`: the password of your MySQL
-   `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST`: the hostname of your MySQL
-   `HBNB_MYSQL_DB`: the database name of your MySQL
-   `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE`: the type of storage used. It can be “file” (using  `FileStorage`) or  `db`  (using  `DBStorage`)

### Components

- Build the console;
	-  Create our data model.
	- Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects.
	- Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
-  Build the database connection through SQLAlchemy, the ORM of Python


Using a MySQL storage we replace the file storage (JSON file) by a Database storage and we map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.
